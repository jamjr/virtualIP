VirtualIP 
-- Sometimes I need a server to test -or deploy- my projects but I do not want -or can afford- to pay for a hosting service. Nowadays with domestic fiber speed connections, you can host yourself your projects. There is a catch: The domestic internet connection usually means the end user will have a dinamic ip, so I develop this low cost solution to be able to setup your own server.
